# tripleref
Proof of concept that you can use tripple ref code in Pascal

This is a Delphi (Pascal compatible code) project translated from a C program written by Professor Brailsford demonstrated in a [Computerphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s0w_p5HEuY)

[C source](http://www.eprg.org/computerphile/tripref.c)

At the end of the video the professor speculates this can't be done in Pascal. This project should prove it can be done (although you shouldn't ;-)).
